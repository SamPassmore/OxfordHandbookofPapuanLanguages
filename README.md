Nicholas Evans, Bruno Olsson, Wolfgang Barth, Simon Greenhill, Sam Passmore. 

This is the repository for Evans et al. (2024) "Kinship semantics in Papuan languages". 
We will provide a reference to the chapter and handbook once it is available. 

Here, you will find the data, analysis, and visualization code to produce the results reported in the manuscript. 
They can be reproduced through the build.R file, found in the root folder. Scripts are listed within the build file in running order, with their locations in the repository apparent from the paths.
